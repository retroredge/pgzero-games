This game was written to demonstrate a very simple vertical scrolling shooter game to a friend's son. The code is a simple, procedural Python script. There are no classes, this is deliberate to keep things easy for a beginner to understand. 

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pygame Zero 1.2.1

```
python3 -m ensurepip
pip3 install pgzero
```

## To Run
```
python3 eagle-bug-shooter.py
```

## Controls

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the eagle, space bar to fire. You loose a life everytime a bug reaches the bottom of the screen.

## Graphics and sound effects

The graphics and sound effect used in this game are from the [Code The Classics repository](https://github.com/Wireframe-Magazine/Code-the-Classics) which are described in the excellent book [Code the Classics](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.com/books/code-the-classics1).
